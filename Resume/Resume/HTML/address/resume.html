<h3>MusicNow/AOL MusicNow</h3>
<h3>Chicago, IL</h3>
<p>An online digital media service providing both audio and video for purchase or subscription models </p>
<p>Senior Software Engineer</p>
<p>9/04 - 4/07</p>
<ul>
  <li>Principal engineer that implemented an automated royalty reporting system based in OO Perl that created custom financial reports for more than a thousand licensors in MusicNow's music service. This automated system included report delivery via FTP or e-mail attachment, notification of report delivery via e-mail, and archiving the reports and associated metadata via PL/SQL functions to a web portal server for historical retrieval. The automation of report generation and delivery occurred weekly, monthly, and quarterly.</li>
  <li>Implemented a royalty system based in OO Perl that extracted all digital media plays (audio/video media types, purchase/computer/portable plays) from a data warehouse to calculate costs and then generate the royalty bearing financial figures, per licensor, based on a complex system of financial dependencies outlined by each licensor.</li>
  <li>Implemented a billing system for digital media purchases, new account signups, and batch systems for both subscription renewals and billing period ending dates. This billing system included credit card, debit card, and checking account based transactions. This was built as a mixture of PL/SQL functions and Java classes embedded as PL/SQL functions and communicated to a third-party credit card processing agent via XML messages.</li>
  <li>Principal engineer that implemented a Java XML parsing tool to dynamically create DMCA compliant radio stations based on availability of songs in the service's library and sourced from the XML feed. Due to the large size of the XML files, yet constrained by the need to use a DOM parsing model for repeated, complex segments, a custom SAX/DOM hybrid parser was created.</li>
  <li>Assisted in ongoing development of a custom content management system for the service's digital media library. This included metadata scrubbing tools; automated tools for censoring of metadata for family oriented viewing; and tools to alias key metadata content (artist/album/song name). These tools were written in both CGI Perl and JSP.</li>
  <li>Implemented design and features to the GUI portion of our web service using Dynamo server's Java/JSP, JavaScript, and CSS.</li>
